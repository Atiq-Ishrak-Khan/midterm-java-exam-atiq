Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. It's a set of rules and instructions to the computer to perform some specific task. Because computer only understands Binary (0, 1). But for human, it's
not possible to understand that machine language. So, the programming language helps the human to instruct the computer in human language way which is known
as programing language. The programing language is converted to machine language later on in order to perform that task.




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.JDK means Java Development Kit and it provides all the necessary tools such as compiler, library etc. JDK is composed of bunch of things. They are mentioned
as following:-
Compiler: Compiler is the thing that converts Java source code (human readable) into byte code. This is a low level representation which can be executed by
JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
JVM: JVM means Java Virtual Machine. This one execute bytecode and it's in the runtime environment.
Library: This is basically java standard library which contains some important tools specially for the developer such as ArrayList, HashMap, I/O operations etc.
JRE: JRE means Java Runtime Environment. This actually includes JVM and a set of libraries and the class files that are necessary for running Java applications.
Development tools: Besides JDK, the development tools contains other tools like JavaDoc, debugger etc for managing Java applications.
API Documentation: This actually provides details information about classes and methods available in the standard Java Library.


What is IDE?
A. IDE means Integrated Development Environment. This includes code editor, compiler, debugger, project management and other tools. It help the developer to develop
the product more efficiently.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. There are lots of IDEs available in the market to support java. Some of them are IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, BlueJ, Net Beans etc.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. The java life cycle starts with the code editor which is basically the IDE where we write our programing language. This is called source code (contains .java extension)
and this source code is compiled into byte code using the Java Compiler (javac). The converted byte code has ".class" extension. This phase is called compiling environment.
And this byte code goes through JVM before converted into machine code. Inside JVM, there are Java Interpreter and Just-in-time compiler which helps to convert that
into machine language. This phase is called run-time environment.


what is class?
